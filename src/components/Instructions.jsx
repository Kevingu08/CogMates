          CogMates is a memory game designed to test and improve your skills.
          The objective of the game is to find all matching pairs of cards.
          Hereâ€™s how it works:
        </p>
        <ol className="text-left list-decimal list-inside mt-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
          <li>
            <strong>Select Cards:</strong> At the start of the game, all cards
            are laid face down. You must select one card and then another.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Match Cards:</strong> If the two cards you selected match,
            you earn a point, and both cards will remain face up.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Match:</strong> If the cards do not match, they will be
            turned face down again, and you will need to remember their
            positions for future attempts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timer:</strong> There is a timer that sets a time limit for
            the game. You must find all the matching pairs before the time runs
            out to win.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 mt-4">
          The game is not only fun but also helps improve your memory and
          concentration skills. Good luck!
